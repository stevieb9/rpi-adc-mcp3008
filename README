NAME

    RPi::ADC::MCP3008 - Interface to the MCP300x analog to digital
    converters (ADC) on Raspberry Pi

DESCRIPTION

    Provides access to the MCP300x series analog to digital converters
    (ADC) on Raspberry Pi.

    Requires wiringPi <http://wiringpi.com> to be installed, as well as
    access to the C pthread library.

SYNOPSIS

        use RPi::ADC::MCP3008;
    
        my $adc = RPi::ADC::MCP3008->new;
    
        ...

METHODS

 new

    Instantiates and returns a new RPi::ADC::MCP3008 object. All parameters
    are sent in as a single hash.

    Parameters:

        $mode

    Optional. Sets the operating mode. 0 for single-ended mode, or 1 for
    differential mode. See "OPERATING MODES" for further details.

        $spi

    Optional. Sets the SPI channel the ADC is listening on. 0 for SPI
    channel 0 (which is the default), and 1 for SPI channel 1.

 mode

    Sets/gets the ADC's operating mode.

    Parameters:

        $mode

    Optional. 0 for single-ended mode, or 1 for differential mode. See
    "OPERATING MODES" for further details.

    Return: The currently used mode.

 spi

    Sets/gets the SPI channel the ADC is connected to.

    Parameters:

        $channel

    Optional. 0 for SPI channel 0 (which is the default), and 1 for SPI
    channel 1.

    Return: The currently used SPI channel number.

TECHNICAL DATA

    Both the MCP3004 and MCP3008 are supported. The MCP3004 has four input
    pins in single-ended mode and two input channel pairs in differential
    mode. The MCP3008 has eight inputs in single-ended mode, and four input
    pairs in differential mode.

 OPERATING MODES

    The MCP300x ADCs have two operating modes, single-ended and
    differential. In single-ended mode, the input result is the difference
    between the analog input pin and ground. In differential mode, the
    result will be the difference between the input pin, and it's
    corresponding diff pin.
